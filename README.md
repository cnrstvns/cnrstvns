## Hello
I'm Connor, a full-time Student as well as Software Engineer in my free time. I've been involved in various start-ups and worked on many side-projects over the past few years. I primarily write code in Typescript nowadays, but occasionally will use JavaScript or Python for a project. 

If you're looking to get in touch with me, my email can be found on [my website](https://cnrstvns.dev) â€” or reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/crnstvns)
